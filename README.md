# Analogic-Millenium-Copyleft-Act (version 1.0)
An licence to deal with companies that dont respect your rights.

# Licence:
This licence apply to code and assets in general including pictures , drawings music, and any other form of human expression, aka art.
when an piece of code or media asset is licenced under that licence, the owner of the licence grants the use of the same to train AI, under the single following condition:
you must give up on your rights to any copyrights you own, any patent and any trademarks.


# Motivation
In the era of "Artificial Inteligence", a bunch of copyright and copyleft work has been stolen to be used to feed into machine learning algorithms to train AI to generate stuff.
Some of those stuff generated looks like the original content that was used to train then, wich can be classified as plagiarism, even when it dont resemble the original work, the content of tons of people have being used to train those "ai" technologies without their consent.

Big companies love to complain when someone violate their IP, but they dont think twice before stealing content from others, this licence wont prevent that, instead it make the playing field fair again: we give up on our rights if you do with yours.

There have been a lot of cases where an so called "Ai", created some content, that look close enough to some content on the training data to be recgonized as plagiarism, if that ever happen again, with some piece of code or media that is licenced under that licence, you can use this as proof that your content was stolen and as an result, the ones who stole it should gave up their rights.

If an company dont want to risk lose their rights, they can simply respect this licence.

Btw: check with your lawyer if an licence like that may apply to your country.
